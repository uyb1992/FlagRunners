# FlagRunners

The application will incorporate smartphones into the outside game “capture the flag.” 
It will require use of the GPS capabilities of the android device to order to play the game. 
Game only supports a free-for-all capture the flag (FFA). 
In FFA mode, users will be able to “deploy” flags within a set radius of their general area that they themselves or any other user can capture; flags deployed will remain indefinitely until captured. Users can only deploy a finite amount of flags a day in fixed time increments. Flag capture will be implemented through the use of a soft “Capture Flag” button that will be available to the user once they are at the geographical location of the deployed flag.  In order to facilitate low user population (such as when the app is first starting out), the application will periodically deploy flags that are free for any user to capture.
